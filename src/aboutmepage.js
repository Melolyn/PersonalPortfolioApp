            <p className='paragraph'>Welcome to my personal website! I'm Lynn Zein, artist name "Melolyn". I began my academic journey studying Human Resources Management, 
                where I developed a strong foundation in understanding people and organizational dynamics. 
                However, my passion for technology led me to pivot my focus to Software Engineering, where Iâ€™m currently honing my skills in coding and web development. 
                Alongside my technical pursuits, I express my creativity through rap music, blending my love for rhythm and storytelling. 
                Here, you'll find a showcase of my projects, both in web development and my musical creations. Thank you for stopping by!</p>
